# Data Science Capstone & Ethics (ENGI E4800)

## Course overview

This course provides a unique opportunity for students in the MS in Data Science program to apply their knowledge of the foundations, theory and methods of data science to address data driven problems in industry, research, government and the non-profit sector. The course activities focus on a semester-long project sponsored by an affiliate company or a Columbia faculty member. The project synthesizes the statistical, computational, engineering and social challenges involved in solving complex real-world problems. The course has a well developed Ethics component supported by Dr. Savannah Thais.
